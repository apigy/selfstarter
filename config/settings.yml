# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)

# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/preorder/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product
# It should be in app/assets/images

# On Lockitron, this is "Only $149 for a limited time"

# Social Stuff
facebook_app_id: "1234567890"

# If you want to change the images for the key points (e.g. "Kickstarter is not a store")
# They're in app/assets/images/#{pointer_number}-background.png
# So, the first key point, it's at app/assets/images/1-background.png
# Alternatively, change it up in app/assets/stylesheets/homepage/key_points.css.scss
