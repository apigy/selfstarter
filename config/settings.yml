# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - dollar amount
# NOTE: if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)
project_goal: 100000

# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/preorder/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header
product_name: "2theGig"
#if display_logo is set to true it will show up instead of the product_name although the title still uses the product name - if you set display_logo to true set logo_image to the name of your image as well - to turn this off just set display_logo to false
display_logo: true
logo_image: "ToTheGigLogo.png"
#width & height will be used to display the image, you can use any number plus the unit such as px em rem % vw vh or auto 
#example '200em' 'auto' '10%' or '30vw'
l_width: '300px'
l_height: 'auto'

# This will be used in sentences like Hooray You've just reserved product_description
product_description: "a set of widgets"

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product
# It should be in app/assets/images

# YouTube or Vimeo Video URL (The embed URL, without the query string options)
# Replace /embed/ in your video url path with /v/ for video playback to work.
video_embed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkQcZ8A01AA"

# If set to true, then the image at "/assets/video_placeholder.png" will be shown in place of the youtube
# video.  When the user clicks it, the vid will replace the image and start playing.
#
# NOTE: you can set this to false, and no image will be use - first frame of the video will be displayed
#
# NOTE: this only works for youtube video at the moment.  If its not for youtube, then just leave this property blank
