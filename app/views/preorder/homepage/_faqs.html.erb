          <summary>How do I contact a musician directly?</summary>
          <p>The best way is in <code>config/settings.yml</code>. It has variables for several different parts, the video, the product name, the call to action button ("Fork Now"), and several more.

          <summary>What is a "Founding Member"? What do you mean by "Pre-Launch Rate"?</summary>
          <p>Head over to <code>app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss</code>. It makes it easy to change around the elements used throughout the HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alternatively, you can dive right into the CSS, have a look at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss</code>.</p>

          <summary>When will the service be live? What is pre-buy?</summary>
          <p>We are using this site and your interest to finish the creation and launch of To The Gig. It's like our own version of Kickstarter. We have 95% of the technology working, but we don't want to launch until we have a few thousand members ready to go! That's what makes our site valuable. <br /><br />As of January 2016 we have almost 2,000 musicians raring to go! Join us.</p>

          <summary class=''>How is this different than the hundreds of other Gig Sites?</summary>
          <p>It's a Ruby on Rails app that makes heavy use of SCSS, Kickstarter's wonderful <code>amazon_flex_pay</code> gem, and a hint of CoffeeScript.</p>
